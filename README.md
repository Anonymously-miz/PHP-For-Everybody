### Using Docker instead of XAMPP/MAMP/etc.
You'll need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer. Clone this repo. `cd` into this repo and run `make build` and then `make up`. Once that's done installing if you type `docker container ls -a` you'll see your active docker containers. More details in the full repo at [PHP-Docker](https://github.com/KalobTaulien/PHP-Docker)

If this entire section either confused you or scared you, feel free to ignore it. The Docker setup is entirely optional for this course.
